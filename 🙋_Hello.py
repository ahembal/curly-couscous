    Welcome to interactive CV page.
    
    I created this page as a visualization of my works to follow up easily, to find connections between each other, and to make collaborations easier.
    
    I think this page can make recruitment [process easier](https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2015/nov/11/why-you-dont-need-a-cv-to-get-your-next-job) for [recruiters](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-strategy/what-is-recruitment), 
    because it is [almost impossible to explain](https://blog.recright.com/cvs-are-less-relevant-for-recruiters) 
    my works in [few pages of PDFs](https://thrivemap.io/6-reasons-we-should-stop-asking-for-cvs/).

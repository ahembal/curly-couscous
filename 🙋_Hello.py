    After spending few months with sending CVs to the 
    [*lovely recruiters*](https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-strategy/what-is-recruitment),
    I **realized** it is [almost impossible to explain](https://blog.recright.com/cvs-are-less-relevant-for-recruiters) 
    my works in [few pages of PDFs](https://thrivemap.io/6-reasons-we-should-stop-asking-for-cvs/) ,
